## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to better manipulate the DOM using javascript. I also learned how to validate forms using javascript. This project also reinforeced resposive design and mobile first principles.

### Continued development

I want to focus on making my javascript more readeable and modular. I was able to use javascript to validate the form but want to make my code more efficent and compact. I want to focus on improving and understanding more ways to affect the DOM with javascript. I also want to continue to focus on how to improve my reponsive design.
